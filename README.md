# Boiler-flat

Replicates dev folder structure for dynamic products. <br>
Styles and scripts build in corresponding folders. The presumption is this build process is just for dev. For production a proper build method will be used and files copied into a Build folder in root.<br>

### Specs
**Grunt** - Does not minify anything or anything else fancy. <br>
**Styles** - SASS with Bourbon <br>
**Scripts** - JQuery. That's it. Keeping it real.
