# Boiler-flat

Replicates development folder structure for dynamic products. <br>
Styles and scripts build in corresponding folders. Isn't the neatest but allows for easy move to dynamic projects.<br>

### Features
**Grunt** - Does not minify anything or anything else fancy. <br>
**Styles** - SASS with Bourbon <br>
**Scripts** - Structure is not great but assumes it'll be reconstructed for dynamic site.
